#CuseHacks2018 

Major League Hacking (MLH) Hackathon at Syracuse University

Our idea was to make a safe walking app where a user would put in a destination and a path would be generated that would calculate the shortest path to that destination and also the safetest route according to any reported crime report from DPS (department of public safety) here at SU.
